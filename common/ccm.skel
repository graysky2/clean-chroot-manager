# Fully qualified path for clean chroots.
# Neither path should use a variable like $HOME.  If your machine has lots

# physical media, it will not survive a reboot. See the manpage for tips.

# Number of threads makepkg in the clean chroot will use when building.
# The typical rule is physical cores + 1.

# If set, the value defined will be used in the chroot's /etc/makepkg.conf
# for PACKAGER= which will be auto uncommented.
PACKAGER=""

# If set, the value defined will be used in the chroot's /etc/makepkg.conf
# for CFLAGS= and will be mirrored automatically for the CXXFLAGS= therein.

# Arch default: "-march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe -fno-plt"
# If you like color while building, append -fdiagnostics-color=always like this:
# "-march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe -fno-plt -fdiagnostics-color=always"

# Optionally define the format of compression for compiled packages.

# Set this variable to anything if you want to run namcap on the built package
RUNNAMCAP=

# Set this to anything if you want makepkg to build through distcc for faster
# compilation. You must have distcc installed and properly configured on your
# native environment (not within the chroot) as well as on each of the volunteers
# you define below.
#
# Alternatively, you can invoke ccm with the 'cd' flag to create the chroot
# with distcc enabled rather than editing this value.
#
# For more on distcc, see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Distcc
RUNDISTCC=

# This is only needed for users planning to build with distcc. Take care to
# include the localhost plus all volunteers you define below. Don't over-
# think this one. Performance doesn't suffer if you over-shoot the value to
# account for physical core + 1 on the localhost and volunteers
DISTCC_THREADS=

# Define all machines in the distcc cluster below using the distcc syntax of:
# "hostname/threads" and remember to list localhost/n first, followed by your
# volunteer nodes listed in decreasing order of CPU power. Additional supported
# options are passed through, see the manpage for distcc.
