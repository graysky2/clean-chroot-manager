# Fully qualified path for clean chroots.
# Neither path should use a variable like $HOME.  If your machine has lots

# Set this to an in-memory path such as /tmp/build to build in memory. The

# Path to a default makepkg.conf that is copied to a new chroot. Note that
# the options further down will override those in the default makepkg.conf.

# Number of threads makepkg in the clean chroot will use when building.

THREADS=9

# If set, the value defined will be used in the chroot's /etc/makepkg.conf
# for PACKAGER= which will be auto uncommented.

# If set, the value defined will be used in the chroot's /etc/makepkg.conf
# for CFLAGS= and will be mirrored automatically for the CXXFLAGS= therein.

# Arch default: "-march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe -fno-plt"

# Set this variable to anything if you want to run namcap on the built package
RUNNAMCAP=

# Set this to anything if you want makepkg to build through distcc for faster
# compilation. You must have distcc installed and properly configured on your
# native environment (not within the chroot) as well as on each of the volunteers
# you define below.
#
# Alternatively, you can invoke ccm with the 'cd' flag to create the chroot
# with distcc enabled rather than editing this value.

# For more on distcc, see: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Distcc
RUNDISTCC=

# This is only needed for users planning to build with distcc. Take care to
# include the localhost plus all volunteers you define below. Don't over-

# account for physical core + 1 on the localhost and volunteers
DISTCC_THREADS=

# Define all machines in the distcc cluster below using the distcc syntax of:
# "hostname/threads" and remember to list localhost/n first, followed by your
# volunteer nodes listed in decreasing order of CPU power. Additional supported
# options are passed through, see the manpage for distcc.
